This repo contains the codes for generating datasets and reproducing results in paper. The codes were tested under Python 2.7.5, TensorFlow 1.4.0.

## Preparing datasets

### 3D Teapot
3D Teapot dataset was originally proposed by [Eastwood et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=By-7dz-AZ). However, the code for generating this dataset was not published, thus we cannot calculate [Kim & Mnih disentanglement metric](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05983) which requires additional data. We try to reproduce the dataset, and make several extensions to it, based on [this renderer](https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr) by Pol Moreno. We provide all our codes for generating the datasets. 

The steps of running 3D Teapot dataset generator by your own are as follows:

* `git clone https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr`.
* Copy all files in `3D_teapot` folder in this repo to `opendr` folder.
* Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr](https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr) to install the required library, and download `teapotModel.pkl` to `opendr/data` folder.
* `cd opendr`. Then you can run:
	* `python generate_teapots_all_color_incomplete_rotation_up_light.py`: this code tries to reproduce [the original 3D Teapot dataset](https://github.com/cianeastwood/qedr), which contains teapots with different colors, incomplete rotations, and the light source is from the top. Note that since we do not know the parameters (e.g., teapot size, shape translation) that the original dataset uses, the data generated by this code may be different from the original one. 
	* `python generate_teapots_fixed_color_complete_rotation_up_light.py`: this code generates teapots with a fixed color, all possible rotations (uniformly), and the light source is from the top.
	* `python generate_teapots_fixed_color_complete_rotation_uniform_light.py`: this code generates teapots with a fixed color, all possible rotations (uniformly), and the direction of the light source is also uniformly random among all possibilities.
	> Those three files are modified from [generate_teapots.py](https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr/blob/master/generate_teapots.py).
* After running the above codes, you will get the following files in a corresponding folder

```
train_data/
├── data.npz
metric_data/
├── data.npz
```
`train_data/data.npz` contains samples for training, and `metric_data/data.npz` contains samples for evaluating [Kim & Mnih disentanglement metric](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05983). Please copy them (keep directory structure) to the `data` folder in code (see below).



### CelebA
Download `img_align_celeba.zip` from [https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) (or other source), and put it in `CelebA` folder. Then run `python process_celeba.py`. This code will crop and resize the images into 32x32x3 format. Please copy the generated `data.npz` to the `data` folder in code (see below).


### dSprites
Download `dsprites_ndarray_co1sh3sc6or40x32y32_64x64.npz` from [https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset](https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset) and put it in the `data` folder in code (see below).
